	help
	  This selects the "Tulip" driver support for Aspeed Pilot.

	depends on PILOT4_NET_TULIP
	help
	  NAPI is a new driver API designed to reduce CPU and interrupt load
	  when the driver is receiving lots of packets from the card. It is
	  still somewhat experimental and thus not yet enabled by default.

	  If your estimated Rx load is 10kpps or more, or if the card will be
	  deployed on potentially unfriendly networks (e.g. in a firewall),
	  then say Y here.

	  See <file:Documentation/networking/NAPI_HOWTO.txt> for more
	  information.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config TULIP_NAPI_HW_MITIGATION
	bool "Use Interrupt Mitigation "
	depends on TULIP_NAPI
	---help---
	  Use HW to reduce RX interrupts. Not strict necessary since NAPI reduces
	  RX interrupts but itself. Although this reduces RX interrupts even at
	  low levels traffic at the cost of a small latency.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

config PILOT_SG
	depends on MACH_PILOT4_ASIC
	bool "Enable SG support"
	help
	  Enable NIC Scatter/gather support and inform the Linux stack
